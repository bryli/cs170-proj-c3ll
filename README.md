Instructions:

Open solver.py. Under the function "solve", change the "STEPS" variable to the desired number of iterations you would like to run the simulated annealing for. Under the else statement of "if __name__ == 'main'", change the list in the statement "if size not in []" to contain the words 'small', 'medium', 'large'. This will run all the inputs for the desired number of iterations you specified. Once all of this has been set, run solver.py. This will generate the outputs folder with the .out files. Rename this folder "output_old". Create another folder called "outputs" with subdirectories "small", "medium", "large". After this, run refineSolution.py.

For our submitted solutions, we ran all input files at various numbers of steps including 10000, 100000, 500000, 1000000.
