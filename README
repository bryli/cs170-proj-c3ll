Open solver.py. Under the function "solve", change the "iterations" variable to the desired number of iterations you would like to run the simulated annealing for. Under the else statement of "if __name__ == '__main__'", change the list in the statement "if size not in []" to contain the words "'small', 'medium', 'large'". This will run all the inputs for the desired number of iterations you specified. Once all of this has been set, run using "python3 solver.py" or any way you naively run a python3 program.
